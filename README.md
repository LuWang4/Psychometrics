1) Introduction
According to William James (1890), self-esteem is a construct capturing the positive level of a person towards themselves. More recently, it was defined as the affective-cognitive component of a personâ€™s self-system (Shapurian, Hojat, & Nayerahmadi, 1987). In order to test self-esteem, Rosenberg, M (1965) published The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. It became the most popular scale in self-esteem evaluation. However, Researchers argue about the dimensionality of the scale whether it is unidimensional or bifactorial. This study will try to answer the following research questions: 

Research question 1: how is the reliability of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and how is he 10 items internal consistent?

Research question 2: Is the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) unidimensional or Bifactorial? How many laten variables tested in RSES? 

Research question 3: Are all the 10 items work well in the RSES? Do they discriminate people with positive and negative evaluations one themselves well? Is there any extreme items in the scale?

2) Method

Subjects:
The sample consisted of 45,943 participants 6 to 100 years old (M = 26.3, SD = 7.0). The data was collected through the survey from a public online interactive version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Most of the respondents were female (Female = 61.2%, Male = 37.3%, unidentified or others = 1.5%). The participants were informed that their data would be saved at the beginning of the survey. At the end of the survey, 75.7% of the participants consent that they had given accurate responses and the data could be used for research. The dataset only contains the those consented.
